# 🚄 Northeast Maglev Web Analytics Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive **web analytics dashboard** built with **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and **Looker Studio** as part of my marketing and outreach internship at **Northeast Maglev**. The dashboard was designed to help the team track visitor behavior, campaign performance, and engagement trends across the site.

## 📍 Overview

As part of my internship with Northeast Maglev, I created a custom analytics dashboard to transform raw GA4 data into actionable insights for the outreach and marketing teams. The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as traffic sources, session trends, user locations, and supporter engagement.

> **Note:** Some visualizations in this version have been edited and interactivity removed to protect sensitive internal data and comply with privacy guidelines.
